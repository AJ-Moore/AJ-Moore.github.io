I've been programming for around 18 years, 8 years of which I've spent developing commercially applications, experiences & games. At my most recent position, factory 42 I work as a senior programming developing mixed reality experiences and games for the meta quest.

Our most recent game to release being Unearthed which is available on the meta quest store here: 
<a src="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/6894518023998298/"> Unearthed </a>

During my time as a developer I've worked with a mixture of technologies and fulfilled a number of roles from game development in Unity & Unreal, working on mixed reality games & gamified experiences for ar & vr devices such as the magic leap, meta quest 2, meta quest pro & mobile. Web & app development in react, javascript & cordova, Application development in OpenGL for android,iOS & UWP. Game/ application development for HTC's vive, CI/ CD pipelines & tools for commercial video games, both front end and back end devlopment developing REST apis, server infrastructure and network applications using sockets in c++, including TCP/ UDP solutions and even nat punchthrough, graphics & shader programming for visulisition and computer vision, as-well as a bit of compute shaders and genuinely many more technologies & languages. My passion is definitely more for game systems programming & graphics programming though I do also enjoy network programming. 

In my spare time I like to work on my own personal projects some of my most notable projects to date being a Nintendo Entertainment System emulator I wrote in 2020 source on my github and a Physically Based Rendering engine in OpenGL & Vulkan I am still working on, this recently has spawned several new projects which are very early in development include a c++ network library and a new lua game framework and a bunch of other libraries which I am very excited about, some of which I intend to publish.
